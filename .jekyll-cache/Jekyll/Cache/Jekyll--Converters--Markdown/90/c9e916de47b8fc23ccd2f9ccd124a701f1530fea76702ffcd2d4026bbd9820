I"¢<p>If you would have asked me what do I do four years ago, I would have said something like <em>â€œIâ€™m a chemical engineer, I work with users of radioactive material, helping them to ensure safety in the transport of such materials.  Iâ€™m also learning about nuclear security, and Iâ€™m very excited about the idea of applying what I know about processes and quality management in any nuclear facility.â€</em></p>
