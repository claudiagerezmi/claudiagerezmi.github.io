I"“<p>Fabi looks at me and politely asks <em>â€œMe pasas las trays?â€</em> I give her the trays so she can clean them.  Iâ€™m stretching the dough to prepare pizzas.  <em>â€œHow many do we need?â€</em> I ask Alejandro.  He answers, <em>â€œSolo tres, por favor. â€</em></p>

<p>I work in a pizza restaurant in Toronto.  My team is quite a multinational one, with people coming from Mexico, Ecuador, England, Guyana, Guatemala, Italy, and Argentina.  We all speak Spanish at different levels.  We all speak English as well.  And we love to mix them up.</p>

<p>I wasnâ€™t always able to speak Spanish and English at the same time.  I can divide my relationship with English through time in three stages:</p>

<h2 id="learning-stage-a-conscious-effort">Learning stage: A conscious effort.</h2>

<p>I first studied English at school when I was 12 years old.  And then when I was 15, I attended classes at a private English Institute.  <em>â€œEnglish is important; youâ€™ll need it someday,â€</em> everybody said.  To me, it was just another school requirement.  I had no use for it at the moment.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t until I attended university that I found a motive to polish my English skills.  In engineering, it is important to be up to date with scientific literature, which means reading books, papers, and new publications most of which are in English.  Reading in English became a weekly habit.</p>

<p>But then after graduation, I forgot about it for a while, until one day I tried <a href="https://www.conversationexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conversation Exchange</a>, a website that lets you practice your second language by meeting up with native speakers living in your area.  Thatâ€™s how I met Chris, now my husband.</p>

<p>Having someone that I trusted made it easier for me to improve my speaking, writing, and listening skills.  I could ask Chris to repeat things, to rephrase sentences, to go slower, to correct my pronunciation, etc.  I could make mistakes and not feel so silly about them.</p>

<h2 id="acquisition-stage-getting-immersed-in-a-new-language">Acquisition stage: Getting immersed in a new language.</h2>

<p>Then I moved to North America, and English became a necessity.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I couldnâ€™t understand what people said at normal speed; they had to slow down and emphasize the words for me to understand.  My responses were slow too; I had to think before speaking.  I was unable to talk on the phone.  In a face-to-face conversation, I could use and read body language.  On the phone, I felt helpless.  My personality changed, I became quieter.  I had always been keen to socialize, and I enjoyed light-hearted conversation with new people.  Now, I had a feeling of anxiety every time I had to attend a social event.</p>

<p>But then, all those negative feelings faded away with time.  My English improved; but this time it wasnâ€™t conscious effort (I wouldnâ€™t sit to memorize vocabulary or do exercises on a textbook), it was as if I were acquiring the knowledge by osmosis.  One day I started to have dreams in English.  The other day I understood the meaning of a song in the radio.  Next I could turn off the Spanish subtitles on the TV.  Suddenly I could engage in deeper conversations.  I could make funny comments, and eventually, I felt a little more like my old self.</p>

<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>

<p>After almost two years living abroad, I came back to Buenos Aires for a visit.  In my first conversation with an old friend, I was like a little cockatoo.  I talked non-stop.  And my friend laughed at me non-stop.  I was translating thoughts from English to Spanish! Phrases such as <em>â€œYo creoâ€</em> (I think so.), at the end of a sentence, or <em>â€œSuena bien!â€</em> (â€œSounds good!â€), are not common in Spanish.  I kept repeating them.  Also, every few minutes I had this experience of having a word <em>â€œen la punta de la lenguaâ€</em> (at the tip of the tongue), and I just couldnâ€™t spit it out.  Also, my friend recalled, my Argentinian accent was subtle.  And this was confirmed by people that would ask where I was from.</p>

<p>I felt I was a foreigner in my own country.</p>

<p>Luckily, in a few days, I was speaking proper Argentinian again.  But until the day I left, I had the impression that something was different.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m living in Toronto now, the most multicultural city Iâ€™ve ever been to, and here I speak English and Spanish every day.  It feels like a new phase in which the challenge is to be able to handle both languages simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>So, in my experience, just the first two steps of going through a conscious effort to learn a new language and then immersing in it, are a very effective way to become fluent in a second language.  I still speak with a non-native accent, I still make grammar mistakes, and I have to work on my pronunciation and vocabulary, but overall I feel confident communicating in English.</p>
